## 7. Risks and Assumptions

### Assumptions
- Team member utilization rates are maintained as planned (full-time 100%, part-time 50%)
- LPR equipment and AI recognition engine are selected and delivered within the M2 (Infrastructure Setup) period
- Legacy dispatch/weighing system data structure analysis is completed during the analysis phase
- H/W equipment delivery requires 4 weeks after procurement order
- Kakao API and SMS service contracts are completed before development starts
- Active support from business/PMO (monthly review meetings, design approval, UAT participation)
- Development environment (server, DB, CI/CD) is set up before development starts

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| LPR equipment delivery delay | HIGH | Early procurement, alternative vendor identification, CS development proceeds with simulator |
| AI recognition engine selection delay | HIGH | Accelerate benchmark schedule, evaluate multiple candidates in parallel |
| Legacy system migration complexity exceeds expectations | MEDIUM | Early migration PoC execution, secure parallel operation period |
| Requirements changes | HIGH | Establish change management process, utilize buffer (20%), monthly review meetings |
| H/W integration issues (RS-232C, LPR, sensors) | MEDIUM | Allocate H/W integration testing period, spare equipment, manufacturer technical support |
| Staff attrition | HIGH | Strengthen documentation, knowledge sharing, cross-training, key personnel retention |
| On-site testing environment constraints (live vehicle operation) | MEDIUM | Secure business cooperation schedule in advance, plan for evening/weekend testing |
| Flutter iOS/Android compatibility issues | LOW | CI automated build testing, advance beta testing |
