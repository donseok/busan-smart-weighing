## 1. Executive Summary

### Key Message

The Busan Plant weighbridge currently faces limitations inherent to its RFID-based manual operation. Recurring issues include safety hazards during paper weighing slip collection, inefficiencies caused by multiple RFID cards for multi-dispatch scenarios, and excessive workload on specific departments due to concentrated phone inquiries.

The **Smart Weighing System** fundamentally resolves these problems by combining LPR (License Plate Recognition) + AI technology, a mobile application, and electronic weighing slips.

| Key Metric | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Unmanned automatic weighing ratio | 90% or higher |
| Paper weighing slip usage | 0% (Paperless) |
| Weighing processing time reduction | 30% or more |
| Weighing error rate reduction | 50% or more |
| License plate recognition rate | 95% or higher |

### Investment Overview

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Project Duration | April ~ November 2026 (8 months) |
| Total Effort | 498 MD (24.9 M/M), 598 MD (29.9 M/M) with buffer |
| Team Composition | 9 members (6 full-time + 3 part-time) |
| Methodology | Hybrid (Waterfall-based + Agile sprints) |
| Pohang Plant Prior Experience | Proven expertise in smart weighbridge (LPR) operations |

## 2. Current Situation and Challenges

### 2.1 Current Operations

The Busan Plant weighbridge operates on a **RFID scan -> paper weighing slip printing -> collection** workflow. While this approach supports basic weighing operations, the following structural issues occur repeatedly on-site.

### 2.2 Key Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Safety Risk -- Unsafe Conditions During Paper Slip Collection
Unsafe situations arise when vehicle drivers collect paper weighing slips at the weighbridge. Drivers must exit their vehicles to collect slips, and exchanging documents near moving vehicles creates blind spots in on-site safety management.

#### Challenge 2: Operational Inefficiency -- Multiple RFID Cards for Multi-Dispatch
When multiple dispatches are assigned to a single vehicle, separate RFID cards are required for each dispatch. This creates ongoing administrative costs for RFID card issuance, management, and lost card handling.

#### Challenge 3: Workload Overload -- Concentrated Phone Inquiries to Specific Departments
When issues arise at the weighbridge, phone inquiries concentrate on a specific department (Logistics Control Room). All calls are directed to a single department regardless of inquiry type, severely overloading that department's operations.

#### Challenge 4: Accuracy Limitations -- Complex Weighing Processes and No Re-Weighing
The complexity of 1st/2nd/3rd weighing processes leads to frequent errors and delays. Under the current structure where re-weighing is not possible, opportunities for error correction are limited.

#### Challenge 5: System Obsolescence -- Fragmented Dispatch/Weighing Management Systems
Existing dispatch and weighing management systems operate separately, resulting in poor data consistency. Outdated UI/UX further compounds user inconvenience.

## 3. Cost of Inaction

The following outcomes are anticipated if the current approach is maintained.

| Area | Expected Outcome If Current State Persists |
|------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Safety** | Continued risk of safety incidents during paper slip collection; liability issues in case of accidents |
| **Cost** | Accumulated administrative costs for RFID card issuance, management, and lost card handling; ongoing paper printing expenses |
| **Efficiency** | Weighing delays due to manual processes; increased vehicle wait times during peak hours |
| **Quality** | Persistent weighing errors; degraded data accuracy due to inability to re-weigh |
| **Workforce** | Worsening workload overload on specific departments; risk of staff turnover and burnout |
| **Scalability** | Current system unable to handle increased logistics volume; no foundation for expansion to other plants |
| **Competitiveness** | Declining industry competitiveness due to delayed digital transformation |

> The Pohang Plant already operates a smart weighbridge (LPR). The longer digital transformation is delayed at the Busan Plant, the wider the operational gap between the two plants becomes.

## 10. Risk Management

### 10.1 Key Risks and Mitigation Plans

| # | Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Plan |
|---|------|--------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | **LPR recognition rate below target** (environmental factors: nighttime, rain, contamination) | HIGH | MEDIUM | Dual AI verification, mobile OTP fallback process, auxiliary lighting installation |
| 2 | **AI recognition engine performance delay** (3-second target not met) | HIGH | LOW | Benchmarking during engine selection, local GPU server, lightweight model in parallel |
| 3 | **RS-232C indicator communication instability** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Retry logic, timeout management, serial port monitoring, spare converters |
| 4 | **Legacy data migration failure** | HIGH | MEDIUM | Phased migration, verification checkpoints, rollback plan, parallel operations |
| 5 | **External service outages** (Kakao/SMS) | LOW | MEDIUM | Multi-channel fallback, retry queue, circuit breaker pattern |
| 6 | **LPR equipment delivery delay** | HIGH | MEDIUM | Early procurement, alternative vendors, CS development proceeds with simulator |
| 7 | **Requirements changes** | HIGH | HIGH | Change management process, 20% buffer, monthly review meetings |
| 8 | **Network outage** (weighbridge <-> server) | HIGH | LOW | Local caching with auto-sync, offline mode, redundant network |
| 9 | **Staff attrition** | HIGH | MEDIUM | Enhanced documentation, knowledge sharing, cross-training |
| 10 | **Security vulnerabilities** (OTP hijacking, authentication bypass) | HIGH | LOW | OTP TTL 5 min, IP access control, security audit logs, penetration testing |

### 10.2 Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **20% Schedule Buffer**: 20% buffer (100 MD) secured across total effort to address unforeseen issues
- **Phased Deployment**: Sequential rollout by product category (by-products -> waste -> sub-materials -> outbound -> general) to distribute risk
- **Parallel Operations**: Existing manual weighing (touchscreen) mode maintained in parallel for immediate fallback during outages
- **Monthly Review Meetings**: PMO/development team monthly reviews for early issue detection and response
- **Critical Path Focused Management**: Intensive monitoring of 15 critical tasks (103 MD)
