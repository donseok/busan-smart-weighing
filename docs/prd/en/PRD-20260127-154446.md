## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Background
The Busan Plant weighbridge currently operates by scanning RFID tags and then printing and collecting paper weighing slips. This process introduces safety hazards during paper slip collection, and creates inefficiency when multiple dispatch assignments require multiple RFID cards for the same vehicle. Additionally, when issues arise at the weighbridge, phone inquiries are concentrated on specific departments, resulting in excessive workload.

The complex first/second/third weighing processes frequently cause errors and delays, and the inability to re-weigh limits accuracy improvements. To address these issues, it is necessary to build a smart weighing system that introduces LPR (License Plate Recognition) + AI-based automatic vehicle number recognition, a mobile weighing app, and electronic weighing slips.

The Pohang Plant already has operational experience with smart weighbridges (LPR), and this project aims to apply and extend that experience to the Busan Plant to achieve weighing process automation, safety assurance, and operational efficiency improvements.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Implement unmanned automatic weighing through LPR + AI-based automatic vehicle number recognition
- Achieve paperless operations by introducing electronic weighing slips via mobile app
- Integrate existing dispatch/weighing management systems and modernize UI/UX
- Reduce error rates and improve processing speed through weighing process simplification
- Improve weighing accuracy by developing a re-weighing function

### 1.3 Scope
#### In Scope
- LPR vehicle number recognition system (LPR + AI + mobile OTP secure weighing)
- Smart weighing web management system (dispatch registration, master data, weighing management, gate pass management)
- Weighing CS program (weighbridge program - indicator/LPR integration)
- Weighing management mobile app (login, dispatch inquiry, weighing process, electronic weighing slip, OTP)
- Mobile API (user/dispatch data integration, mobile weighing processing)
- H/W infrastructure deployment (LPR, display board, automatic barrier, radar sensor, vehicle detector, interphone)
- Dual-line telephone system (call routing by inquiry type to logistics control room, materials warehouse, etc.)
- User training and stabilization monitoring

#### Out of Scope
- Pohang Plant weighing system (already deployed)
- Full replacement of ERP or MES systems
- Expansion to other plants (outside the scope of this project)
